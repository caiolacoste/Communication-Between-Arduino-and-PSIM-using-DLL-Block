# Communication-Between-Arduino-and-PSIM-using-DLL-Block

## Introduction

I designed a PI controller for a BLDC motor, running in PSIM, but unfortunatly I didn't find a potentiometer inside the program, for me to test the stability of the system towards a disturbance in the reference signal. This project was then created, to allow easy communication between a real potentiometer connect to an Arduino and the PSIM application. For that, it use da DLL Block inside PSIM, running a C++ application.
